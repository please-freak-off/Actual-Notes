- I FUCKED A GUY NAMED LEONTIY (LEO) AND IT WAS HOT AND GOOD AND I LIKE HIM A LOT.
  IM NOT SURE IF I LIKE WOMEN ANYMORE idk whats wrong with me.
  
  I like talking to him, he has a lot of good stories and has a lot of weird and agreeable opinions. He's basically a chaser except his a trans man. He fucking clawed my back to shit and spanked my like I was his bitch. It was maybe the hottest sex of my life.
  He speaks russian and he has a beagle named Maksim (homophobic dog but a beagle)
  he's getting a strap for the next time i see him.
	- Here's a list of things I know about this weirdo
		- Self reported 2nd Amendment Socialist. idk if he's a marxist, doesn't really seem well studied? no offense to him, just doesn't really seem like a reader.
		- He has russian parents and speaks a good amount. ( I think one of them or he himself might be an alcoholic)
		- He kept saying how much he enjoyed hanging out with me.
		- Comp Sci major but does a lot of Theater Stage Crew work. Has a TD friend named Butch (cis striaght dude) who's very eccentric.
		- is completely fucking based. just like actually cracked.
		- I think has a lot of bourgeois character, but is relatively aware and seems normal about it.
		- he's so hot he's so fucking hto he loves turning me into his bithc jajbfkjnaldf;an sdf
		- After a week of talking to him, he invited me over to his house in boston to sleep over at 9:30 pm. We couldn;t get our hands off each other.
		- He has extremely reasonable expectations of me and I of him. He knows I like cannot possibly handle an emotional dependent at the moment.
		- He agrees w me that like the only valid systems are those who aren't fucking self diagnosed.
- I need to stop fucking Cal - and maybe all women? i don't think i actually enjoy it.
- idk what's happened between now and then. im trying to get the car registered in Massachusetts.
