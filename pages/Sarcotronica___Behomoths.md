- It all started with the Behemoths. They were given fancy scientific nomenclature like "marcrokaryotic" and complicated taxonomies to explain their total absence from the fossil records. Their DNA is not "written in normal ways" perhaps frighteningly is their total lack of telomeres.
- What's more is that several undiscovered plants, animals, and suprachaytes were found creating a rich and deadly ecosystem within the organs of the Behemoths.
- Behemoths are chemeoheterotrophs - they survive on the organic matter that travels into their oral cavities.
- There was some suggestion that due to their similar morphology, amphibians and snakes shared a genetic lineage with them, however this theory tends to only be supported by the most optimistic scientists.
