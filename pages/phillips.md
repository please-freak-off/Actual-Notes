- The weird  evans berrardo shit.
	- i kinda betrayed my own ideals and a close friend to confirm this information.
		- the friend understood this as me invoking the deluzean concept of the lion's claw. fighting the negative with the negative because there is no other option.
	- berrardo and Evans met on an "erotic forum"
	- and that this is why Berrado was hired
	- and further allowed a rumor of berrardo and evans having "something sexual
	- all this per a former philosophy club member
- The venty discord dm stuff.
	- pretty self explanatory
