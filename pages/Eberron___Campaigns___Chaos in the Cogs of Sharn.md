- # Characters
- ### Mykalizd Yunkra of the Unter Dah'khanni
	- #### Personality
		- Goblin Fascist ala Measurehead
		- A member of the Unter Dah'khanni, a goblin nationalist organization that seeks to rebirth the Dahkhanni empire by driving out all foreigners from Sharn.
		- Anything that is not a goblin is cringe. Orcs, Tieflings, and Dragonborn are especially cringe.
		- Will absolutely criticize you for doing anything degenerate.
		- Has a posse of hobgoblins heeding his every word. They're *kinda* horny about it, but will try to hide that. Mykalizd will have absolutely no idea.
		- Respects Humans but thinks they're ultimately uncivilized.
	- #### Purpose in the story
		- Much like Measurehead is guarding access to the docks. He's gaurding access to a crime scene, refusing anyone that is not his employers to see it.
		- His employers are the Tyrants they want to keep the body from being investigated.
- ### [[House Tarkanan]]  Changeling Rogue DMNPC
- ### Dragonborn Brothelworker
- ### Wise Hotdog stand Orc
- ### Human City Watch Can be Bribed with food
- ### Tyrants Boss too in over his own head
