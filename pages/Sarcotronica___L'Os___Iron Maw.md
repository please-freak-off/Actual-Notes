alias:: Iron Maw

- There's a common idea that the city of Iron Maw got his name from the fossilized remains of a beached and fossilized [[Leviathan]]
- It's a huge fucking city for a huge fucking set of chompers. There's buildings in and around the jawline and underneath and  within the skull. Freaky looking thing too.
- In the center of the city was a leviathan maybe 400 something years ago. Remnants of the infrastructure built remain deep within the fossil of the [[Leviathan]], plenty of old world technology to loot for.
- Iron Maw as a city is entrenched in a history far greater than whatever government currently claims to be the rightful custodians of the land.
